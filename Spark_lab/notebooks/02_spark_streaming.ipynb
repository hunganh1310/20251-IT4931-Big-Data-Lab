        "3. **Sliding Windows**: Overlapping windows for continuous, smooth aggregations\n",
        "4. **Watermarking**: Mechanism to handle late-arriving data and manage state\n",

        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Key Takeaways:\n",
        "- **Always use event-time** for accurate analytics, not processing-time\n",
        "- **Tumbling windows** for periodic reports (e.g., hourly sales)\n",
        "- **Sliding windows** for continuous metrics (e.g., moving averages)\n",
        "- **Watermarking** is essential for state management and late data handling\n",

        "### 🚀 Best Practices:\n",
        "- Set watermark threshold based on expected data delays\n",
        "- Use Append mode with watermark for windowed aggregations\n",
        "- Choose window size based on analysis needs (not too small, not too large)\n",
        "- Monitor state size and adjust watermark accordingly\n",
